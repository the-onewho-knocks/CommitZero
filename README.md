# CommitGenie

**AI-powered Git commit messages, right inside VS Code.**

CommitGenie analyzes your staged or modified files using Google's Gemini AI and generates professional, intent-driven commit messages following [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — so you can stay focused on writing code, not describing it.

##  Features

-  **AI-generated commit messages** using Google Gemini
- **Native VS Code integration** — works inside the Source Control panel
- **Supports staged & unstaged changes**
- **Fast** — typical generation time: 300ms–1200ms
- **Conventional Commits** format out of the box
- **Secure** — your API key stays in VS Code settings; only your diff is sent to Gemini
- **Lightweight** — minimal footprint, zero background processes

---

## Installation

### Via VSIX (Manual)

1. Download the `.vsix` file from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Open VS Code
3. Open the Extensions panel (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
4. Click the **`···`** menu (top-right of the panel)
5. Select **Install from VSIX...**
6. Choose the downloaded `.vsix` file
7. Reload VS Code when prompted

---

## Setup

Before using CommitGenie, you need a Gemini API key.

### 1. Get a Gemini API Key

Visit [https://ai.google.dev/](https://ai.google.dev/) and create a free API key.

### 2. Configure VS Code Settings

Open Settings with `Ctrl+,`, then search for **CommitGenie**:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `commitgenie.geminiApiKey` | Your Gemini API key | *(required)* |
| `commitgenie.geminiModel` | Gemini model to use | `models/gemini-2.5-flash` |

Or edit your `settings.json` directly:

```jsonc
{
  "commitgenie.geminiApiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
  "commitgenie.geminiModel": "models/gemini-2.5-flash"
}
```

---

## Usage

1. Open a Git project in VS Code
2. Modify or stage your files
3. Open the **Source Control** panel (`Ctrl+Shift+G`)
4. Click the **CommitGenie** icon in the panel toolbar
5. Your commit message is generated and filled in automatically 

No copying. No context switching. No blank staring at the input box.

---

## Example

### Input — Git Diff

```diff
+ function validateEmail(email) {
+   return /^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/.test(email);
+ }
```

### Output — Generated Commit Message

```
feat(utils): add email validation helper function
```

---

## How It Works

CommitGenie follows a simple five-step pipeline:

```
1. Detect changes    →  Scans modified/staged files in your repo
2. Extract diff      →  Runs git diff to capture what changed
3. Send to Gemini    →  Passes the diff to the Gemini API with a prompt
4. Parse response    →  Extracts and formats the commit message
5. Fill input box    →  Injects the message into VS Code's SCM input
```

---

## Architecture

CommitGenie is built with a clean, modular structure:

```
commit-oracle/

│
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── .env
│
├── src/
│   │
│   ├── extension.js                # Entry point (activation + command registration)
│   │
│   ├── commands/
│   │   └── generateCommitCommand.js   # Handles user clicking "Generate Commit Message"
│   │
│   ├── services/
│   │   ├── gitService.js              # Reads git repo, staged files, and diff

│   │   └── constants.js               # Stores API URLs, extension name, configs
│   │
│   └── config/
│       └── settings.js                # Handles extension configuration and env access
│
└── assets/
    └── icon.svg                      # Extension icon shown in VS Code marketplace
```

### Key Services

**`gitService.js`** — Runs `git diff` (staged or unstaged) and returns the raw diff string.

```js
// Example: get staged diff
const diff = await gitService.getStagedDiff(workspaceRoot);
```

**`geminiService.js`** — Sends the diff to the Gemini API and returns the raw completion.

```js
// Example: generate commit message
const message = await geminiService.generate(diff, apiKey, model);
```

**`commitService.js`** — Orchestrates the flow and injects the result into the SCM input box.

```js
// Example: full pipeline
await commitService.run(context);
```

---

## Security

- API keys are stored in **VS Code's native settings** — never bundled with the extension
- Only the **Git diff** is transmitted to Gemini; no file paths, project names, or metadata
- No data is stored externally or logged
- The extension makes **no network requests** outside of the Gemini API call

---

## Supported Gemini Models

| Model | Notes |
|---|---|
| `models/gemini-2.5-flash` | **Recommended** — fast, accurate, low cost |
| `models/gemini-1.5-flash` | Stable alternative |
| `models/gemini-1.5-pro` | Higher quality, slower and more expensive |

---

## Requirements

- **VS Code** `1.109.0` or newer
- **Git** installed and available in your system `PATH`
- A valid **Gemini API key**

---

## Troubleshooting

### API key not found

```
Error: CommitGenie › Gemini API key is missing
```

**Fix:** Open `Ctrl+,`, search for `CommitGenie`, and paste your key into the `Gemini Api Key` field.

---

### No commit message generated

Ensure all of the following are true:

- You are inside a valid Git repository
- At least one file has been **modified or staged**
- Your Gemini API key is **set and valid**
- You have an active internet connection

---

### Extension not responding

Try reloading the VS Code window:

```
Ctrl+Shift+P → Developer: Reload Window
```

## Philosophy

> *Developers should focus on building systems, not describing trivial diffs.*

Commit messages should reflect **intent** — not just the mechanical "what changed."  
CommitGenie bridges that gap, translating your code changes into clear, purposeful commit messages automatically.
